  ## ðŸŒ­ How It's Made: 
  
  **Tech Used:** React, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Tailwind, Stripe
  
  <p>This application is a Point-of-Sale system designed for managing premium seating orders at an MLB-affiliate stadium. Users can seamlessly navigate seating sections, select specific tables, and place orders from various menu locations within the stadium. With real-time order capabilities, both staff and customers can stay informed and ensure a smooth, enjoyable experience.</p>
  
  
  ## ðŸ¥¨ Optimization: 
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Implement code splitting and lazy loading techniques to improve initial loading times and reduce bundle size, enhancing the application's performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Optimization:</strong> Optimize database queries and indexes to improve the efficiency of data retrieval and manipulation, leading to faster response times and improved scalability as the application's data volume grows.</li>
    <li><strong>Client-Side Caching: </strong> Incorporate client-side caching mechanisms, such as memoization or caching libraries, to reduce unnecessary API calls and improve overall responsiveness, particularly for frequently accessed data.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  ## ðŸ¥¤ Lessons Learned: 
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Effective State Management:</strong> Gained insights into global state management using React Context API, allowing for centralized state management and seamless data sharing between components.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Successfully implemented user authentication and authorization mechanisms using auth providers like Supabase, ensuring secure access control and protecting sensitive application functionalities.</li>
    <li><strong>Stripe Integration:</strong> Learned to integrate and configure the Stripe payment gateway for secure payment processing, including handling payment confirmations and managing client-server communication for successful transactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Modular Component Design:</strong> Embraced modular component design principles, facilitating code reuse, maintainability, and scalability while ensuring separation of concerns and enhancing the overall code organization and readability.</li>
  </ul>
